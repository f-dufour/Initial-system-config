# Introduction

This is a modest bash script I use to automatically set my favorite system configuration after a clean install (for macOS Sierra)
It highly relies on homebrew and other package managers such as npm or apm.

# TODOs

* ~~Add mac App store applications install with mas-cli (https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)~~
* Further configuration of fish shell
* Add snippets in clipy (common Java methods...)
* ~~Set default applications (mac-vim, IINA, iterm2, Chromium)~~
* What about GPG config ? Recover private Keys...
* ~~Restore macOS active edges~~
