# Introduction

This is a modest bash script I use to automatically set my favorite system configuration after a clean install (for macOS Sierra). It makes use of some applescripting to set some system preferences.

It highly relies on [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and other package managers such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com//) or [apm](https://atom.io/packages).

# TODOs

* Add mac App store applications install with [mas-cli](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)
* Further configuration of fish shell
* Add snippets in clipy (common Java methods...)
* ~~Set default applications (mac-vim, IINA, iterm2, Chromium)~~
* What about GPG config ? Recover private Keys...
* ~~Restore macOS active edges~~
