# Introduction

This is a modest bash script I use to automatically set my favorite system configuration after a clean install (for macOS Sierra). It highly relies on homebrew and other package managers such as npm or apm. It also makes use of some Applescripting with inline osascript commands or scpt file calling.

# TODOs (Ideas)

* Add support for macOS Mojave
* ~~Add mac App store applications install with mas-cli (https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)~~
* ~~Further configuration of fish shell~~
* ~~Set default applications (mac-vim, IINA, iterm2, Chromium)~~
* ~~Restore macOS hot corners~~
* Deactivate default automatic brightness of the screen
* Add snippets in clipy (common Java methods...)
