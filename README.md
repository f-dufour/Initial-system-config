# Introduction

This is a modest bash script I use to automatically set my favorite system configuration after a clean install (for macOS Sierra). It highly relies on homebrew and other package managers such as npm or apm. It also makes use of some Applescripting with inline osascript commands or scpt file calling.


# TODOs (Ideas)

* ~~Add mac App store applications install with mas-cli (https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)~~
* Further configuration of fish shell
* Add snippets in clipy (common Java methods...)
* ~~Set default applications (mac-vim, IINA, iterm2, Chromium)~~
* What about GPG config ? Recover private Keys...
* ~~Restore macOS hot corners~~
* Deactivate default automatic brightness of the screen
* Install eclipse plugins: [e(fx)clipse](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/efxclipse), [CDT](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/complete-eclipse-cc-ide), [OS X Eclipse Launcher](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/osx-eclipse-launcher)
